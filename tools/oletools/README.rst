python-oletools
===============

`python-oletools <http://www.decalage.info/python/oletools>`__ is a
package of python tools to analyze `Microsoft OLE2
files <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_File_Binary_Format>`__
(also called Structured Storage, Compound File Binary Format or Compound
Document File Format), such as Microsoft Office documents or Outlook
messages, mainly for malware analysis, forensics and debugging. It is
based on the `olefile <http://www.decalage.info/olefile>`__ parser. See
http://www.decalage.info/python/oletools for more info.
