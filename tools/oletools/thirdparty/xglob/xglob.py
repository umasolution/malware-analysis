xglob

xglob is a python package to list files matching wildcards (*, ?, []),
extending the functionality of the glob module from the standard python
library (https://docs.python.org/2/library/glob.html).

Main features:
- recursive file listing (including subfolders)
- file listing within Zip archives
- helper function to open files specified as arguments, supporting files
  within zip archives encrypted with a password
